## Overview

This analysis is conducted to help improve access to ride-sharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods.the results will show how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer. Pyber would like to have analysis for ride sharing and riders and drivers by city types. this analysis will be also be creating visualizations of rideshare data to help understand the results. 

## Results 

### Ride sharing summary by city type 
The summary rides by city types shows that Urban cities have the bigger pie of total rides. The average fare per rides is the lowest on the Urban cities $24.53 unlike the rural that has the highest $34.62. the average fares by drivers is higher on Rural cities unlike suburban that only have almost $40 or Urban that have arount $16.
Even though the total rides are more in Urban both averages of fares and drivers are low. 



- Rural cities have the least number of rides, drivers, and total fares.
- Urban cities have the greatest number of rides, drivers, and total fares.
- Suburban cities fall in between rural and urban cities
- Rural cities have the highest average fare per ride 
- Urban cities have the lowest average fare per ride

#### Total rides by city type percentages

#### Total fares by city type

#### Total drivers by city type



### Focused on short time period 2019-01-01 to 2019-04-29

- The peak in fares for all city types starts towards the end of February.
- The urban cities fares totaled from $1,600 to $2,500 during this period.
- Rural cities total fares dont exceed $500 during the same period. 


## Summury 

Upon these results, Pyber can consider and work on the following suggestions. 
    
- Increase the fares in the urban cities to compensate drivers who are averaging only $17 per driver
- Increase driverse on both Suburban and Rural cities as the average drivers is high and that will impact the average rides
- Advertising the fares more in Suburban and Rural cities to increase total fares on those city types.
